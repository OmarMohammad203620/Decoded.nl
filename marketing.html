			<h2>The context oof our campaign</h2>

		<p>We want to increase traffic on our website and social media accounts at the end of the 
			campaign to prove we have raised awareness of how our brand relates to NFT. Our most 
			important goal is for our target group to be able to identify themselves with our garments 
			and be unique in a way they want to. A similar brand to ours is the streetwear brand 
			“Overpriced”. What we took as an example for us, from them is that they want to change the 
			term “fashion” as a physical piece of clothing to something online in the digital world. We see 
			that as a chance to make people feel comfortable and nice-looking not only at their workplace 
			but in the virtual world as well. However, from our interviews and polls on social media, we 
			got that people are not yet familiar with how that (NFT) works. In other words, we wanted to 
			l first educate/ provide information to the public about the process and offer them an actual 
			product that is unique for each person who purchases from us. </p>
		<p>Reach objective - We want to reach 500 people on Instagram and 1000 people on TikTok by the 17th of June. </p>
      		<p>Affect objectives - We want our visitors/followers to feel special and curious to be part of a unique and luxurious community by the end of the campaign (until the 17 of June)</p>
		<p>Response objectives- The goal of the brand is to have at least 300 people click on each post by the end of the campaign on Instagram, 50 likes on TikTok on a video, and 20% visits on the website (until the 17 of June). </p>
		<p>Media objectives: The social media channels we will use are Tik Tok (100 followers) and Instagram (120 followers).</p>
		<p>Promotional activities that we used were: Direct marketing and Influencer Marketing.</p>

		<p>Direct Marketing- we send a link with our Instagram page to the all the people we interviewed (from our target group) </p>

		<p>Influencer marketing- We asked two influencers @nikolvatashka (model) and @mogimike (digital creator) to reshare our first post where we explain our brand. </p>
	<p>Which social media platforms do we use: Instagram, TikTok, and the website of the brand.</p>
	<p>Why: Instagram is still the leading platform for users aged 25-34 years which is the age of our target group. We believe that Instagram is an inevitable part of a marketing strategy for a fashion brand in 2022 with its all-visual design. On this platform, you can upload pictures with captions, make engaging posts like polls or just ask a simple question. This platform became very popular in recent years and now has more than 500 million users who check their feed every day. We want to upload short videos since we now know that our target group likes them as said earlier, nice high-quality photos, etc. 
Virtual word of mouth
TikTok is a media platform that had significant growth in the last two years mainly because of the pandemic but not only. As a platform, it grew because it has short videos that are in fact engaging in a funny or informative way. However, it is different from Instagram because you can only share videos and it has a great algorithm that gives you exposure even if you do not have a business account or paid ads. The main reason we chose to use TikTok because of the chance to spread brand awareness thanks to its algorithm. Moreover, we know that this medium is used mainly by the younger generation we cannot deny that its users are growing every minute and the Millennials percentage is growing every year. 
The two platforms are the best way to use the virtual word of mouth/ electronic word-of-mouth since customers can only reshare or even comment and like our posts making us more visible, trusted, valued and of course closer to achieving our goals.
For the first 3 weeks, we defined our style and how exactly we want our socials to look, and we kept them simple to see what will spark interest. </p>
	
	

			<h1>Learning points</h1>

		<p>We expected to gain 50 followers on Instagram at least since we decided to reshare our personal accounts that we have a project. Moreover, since our first post, a lot of the other student accounts followed us as well, so we gained a lot of followers from the beginning. We thought that after that many secure follows and likes the algorithm will notice us and show our posts to more people as well. On TikTok we expected to get a lot of views because we planned 2/3 videos per day which is the perfect number for perfect and fast results. </p>
		<p>We learned that a branding campaign is not something that should last 2/3 weeks especially when you are presenting a new product something that is not yet that popular. A crucial element of our brand is the NFT world which may be considered as a type of digital art, still in its infant period, something that has great potential but is still new to individuals as a term and technology. However, the Decoded team wanted the potential visitors/buyers “to be able to identify themselves with our garments and be unique in a way they want to” We needed more time to explain our idea and have more time to be able to see reactions and comments on what is liked what is not so we can change, grow or see where we missed something. We did gain a lot of followers on Instagram more than expected but we tend to think that this has a lot to do with the fact that we uploaded every type of content possible in this way we were seen by different people with similar interests. In order to meet high expectations which, we think our target group has we had to maybe make a few paid ads so we can become more popular and have more following and interaction on each post.</p>
	  	<p>On the other hand, on TikTok things didn’t go as planned we barely made any followers and interactions as we planned since it is a platform that looks easy and funny to work with, but it is way more complicated. Moreover, you need, and it is preferable to upload around three videos a day in order to grow fast. This led us to think way too much about how and what to record, and how we can make it work. We did check brands with similar products that had great content: professionally capture, an idea, probably a script, popular music, and so on. It turned out that: we did not have that many creative ideas without the actual product, we were not allowed to use popular sounds while having a business account (which helps your video to get popular because of the algorithm), and even when we managed to do some videos, they were taking too much time which we didn’t foresee when we started. Furthermore, we made a Business account which limited us from using popular sounds which is essential in this platform. That’s why we did not grab anyone’s attention because on this platform you have to be sure that you interact with all senses possible as sound, picture, and motion, If this is not combined well then it is hard to make your videos visible to a bigger audience.</p>
		<p>In a perfect scenario, we will first start with research and building the brand then, later on, start on a website+ research, and right after that a good marketing strategy should be considered and executed. The time pressure and wanting huge achievements while having other crucial things happening resulted in the mistakes mentioned above.
To conclude, we had enough followers but a big part of them were other students who were doing the same project. We think that this made our posts mainly visible to them because we were supporting each other. Moreover, it made the algorithm show them our posts more than people from our target group. That is why we think it is essential when you start your campaign to invest money in promotion because this will allow you to target the right audience before you gain followers in an organic way. It will give your brand popularity and visibility. 
Next time when each one of us has such a task we would know that: 
-Customers/Viewers might lose interest if the campaign is too long or too short. We must put ourselves in their shoes. What will spark our interest and for how long? What will make us remember a brand? These are the two main questions that we need to keep in mind before starting a campaign.
-You need to conduct research on how a potential ad will be received and perceived by the target group. However, we did some research but never used a mock-up design of an ad + potential caption to ask individuals what they think, how this makes them feel, to give us pros and cons. 
- Different types of posts (videos, reels, stories, igtv, etc.) always need to be used preferably with popular sound/songs now, something memorable. We did that on a few posts because we were not legally allowed if this was a real company with real products. Maybe it was a better idea (since this is a school project) to use popular songs and sounds to see if they can help us as the internet says.
- Our next step will be to make paid posts/ads because we know that potential visitors or buyers will consider us more trustworthy if we have already people following us and liking the content. We will upload weekly testimonials to make the connection between seller-product-buyer more valuable and personal. We need a budget evenly spread throughout the campaign emphasizing a few more important posts like ones that have information, link, or key visuals.
	- Do not rush to have more than one social media platform if you have not mastered the main or first one. Keep in mind your time.</p>
		<p>Education: Higher education diploma. It requires them to have knowledge of social media trends and how to purchase online as well as interest in tech and art and their collaboration.</p>
		<p>Career:  High paid above the standard, directors/managers, influencers, celebrities</p>
		<h1>Future planning</h1>

		<p>We decided to concentrate more on our Instagram profile more and use TikTok as a way of getting more visibility and some new viewers checking the Instagram profile. </p>
	<p>The first week we only posted on Instagram in order to have some content with information about the idea of the brand and a few posts about how it actually works to get a hoodie with a scannable QR which leads to an NFT piece (digital art). Then we continued posting hyping videos (nice music and dynamic visuals were key) and reels that were later uploaded on TikTok as well. Every day we uploaded a story with a question with possible answers to see how the viewers receive and engage with Decoded. This was used as research rather than actually conducting one.
We did get views and enough followers based on the content uploaded but did not reach our objectives due to the fact that we needed more time.</p>
	<p>This is what we would do differently if we had more time (at least a week). We would specifically explain how the brand works and later present a working website where users can actually go and gather more information about the product, we strongly believe that we would have better results. 
Having a combination of more time and a working website would bring us closer to accomplishing our goals (objectives).
Another thing will be to separate tasks more evenly.</p>
