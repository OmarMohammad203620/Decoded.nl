Our most important goal is for our target group to be able to identify themselves with our garments and be unique in a way they want to. 
A similar brand to ours is the streetwear brand “Overpriced”. Overpriced describes itself as a brand that creates “fashion for the crypto generation”. Its co-founder Leighton James told Hypebeast: “We are a group of artists looking to create art-powered crypto fashion that aims to challenge the conceptions of what luxury fashion is”  (Elan, 2021). What we took as an example for us, from them is that they want to change the term “fashion” as a physical piece of clothing to something online in the digital world. We see that as a chance to make people feel comfortable and nice-looking not only at their workplace but in the virtual world as well. However, from our interviews and polls on social media, we got that people are not yet familiar with how that (NFT) works. In other words, we will first educate/ provide information to the public about the process and offer them an actual product that is unique for each person who purchases from us. </div>
