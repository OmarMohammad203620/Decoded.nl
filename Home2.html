<p>Reach objective - We want to reach 500 people on Instagram and 1000 people on TikTok by the 12 of April</p>
      <p>Affect objectives- We want our visitors/followers to feel special and curious to be part of a unique and luxurious community by the end of the campaign (until the 12 of April)</p>
		<p>Response objectives- The goal of the brand is to have at least 300 people click on each post by the end of the campaign on Instagram, 50 likes on TikTok on a video, and 20% visits on the website (until the 12 of April).</p>
		<p>Media objectives: The social media channels we will use are Tik Tok (100 followers) and Instagram (120 followers).
</p>
		<h1>Target audience</h1>
		<p>Description of the demographic and lifestyle: With the internet making the world smaller and people connected, our target audience is based greatly in first-world countries like the Netherlands. According to Statista Research Departments (2022) “ Western Europe had a social network usage penetration of 79% at the beginning of 2021.” (Newcom and Inzicht, January 2020). We target people with expert to medium knowledge regarding cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens. Their lifestyle is ever developing and coping with the new trends in investments and owning digitally valued art pieces.</p>
		<h1>Target Audiance</h1>
		<p>Age:  25-35 years old</p>
	  <p>Gender:  non-specific
</p>
		<p>Income: Elite class</p>
		<p>Education: Higher education diploma. It requires them to have knowledge of social media trends and how to purchase online as well as interest in tech and art and their collaboration.</p>
		<p>Career:  High paid above the standard, directors/managers, influencers, celebrities</p>
		<h1>Media behaviour of the target audience:
</h1>
	  <h3>What platforms/social media do they use:</h3>
		<p>Individuals from our target group tend to use social media mainly for communication, however, in 2020 a big percentage (57%) use Instagram for entertainment and finding new brands next to sharing photos, videos, etc., the numbers have a steady growth each year especially when the pandemic of COVID-19 started. Other apps that take a bigger percentage like Facebook (82%) and WhatsApp (89%) they sue for reading news and messaging. (Statistiek and Eurostat, 2020)
</p>
		<h3>Activity on social media platforms:</h3>
		<p>Facebook is the platform that remains on top in statistics about which media platforms our target group uses. However, people still have their profiles but since it became known that the platform does leak private information, consumers lost faith and do not spend much time as well as do not use it for finding reliable (Department, 2022). Meanwhile, this is still happening, millennials became more oriented to using Instagram and TikTok, especially during the pandemic. These apps were a great alternative to having fun and finding new businesses or brands over the past two years. By the end of 2021, TikTok and Instagram had the most downloads and millennials were the second largest group using these social platforms (Statista, 2021). Looking at more statistics we are now sure that Millennials do use Instagram in recent years more often to find fashion brands and purchase from online shops. They even prefer checking those social media platforms as a form of trust towards them rather than seeing an ad on the television or on a big billboard (Pengue, 2021). </p>
		<h3>What brands do they like:</h3>
		<p>We looked up which were the most liked and the most popular brands online in 2021: on top of the list there was always Gucci (Beauloye, 2021). It is not a surprise since the luxurious brand changed its marketing strategy to digital storytelling, brighter colors, and of course, they dress a lot of celebrities unlike before. Moreover, luxurious brands like Gucci, Dior, or Channel will always be liked by individuals with enough income to afford them since they are history in the fashion industry (Insider, 2018) (insider, 2018).On the other hand, looking at their website and photos on social media we got inspired to make ours. Nowadays streetwear has become very popular and well-known brands like the ones mentioned above stay up with the trends combining high fashion with streetwear: like hoodies. What our potential consumers would want is exclusivity: The concept of possessing something that no one else has, yet without being excessive about it (Lang, n.d.).</p>
		<h3>How should you position your message:</h3>
		<p>Nowadays a person spends a big portion of money and time online which has become an inseparable part of our lives. That is why our main purpose is to differentiate our product/brand from the other fashion-related brands online or already in digital fashion. We offer something new, not the hoodie itself but the whole package: a hoodie, a physical product with a scannable code that leads the consumer to the actual product- a digital art piece.  A product for the elite class tech lovers, who need to differentiate, a Decoded hoodie is a piece of clothing that provides presents one’s uniqueness through the merge of physical and digital. Unlike “Overpriced “which we consider a competitor, we give an actual garment (Haaff, 2019). We strongly believe in facts and the latest research show that our chosen target group that we can gain more trust and a potential purchase if we use videos and engaging content (Pengue, 2021).</p>
		<h3>What do we want to communicate:</h3>
		<p>As said above we want to communicate that our brand is clearly new since the NFT world is still at an early age in the digital world, especially in fashion. We offer something new and attractive as well as quality products. Decoded is offering a fascinating experience by purchasing not only a high-quality garment but a piece of the new digital trend as well making it exclusive and unique. However, we kept in mind that it’s a new term even for people interested in art, tech, and fashion combined. That is why we made sure that on our website and social media platforms everything is explained well making us trustworthy and thoughtful which is something valued in brands by individuals nowadays  (Teixeira, 2021) </p>
		<h1>Media Tactics- Explain in detail how each social media platform will help you achieve your objectives (think about the unique strengths of each platform)
</h1>
		<h3>Which social media platforms do we use:</h3>
		<p> Instagram, TikTok, and the website of the brand.
Why: Instagram is still the leading platform for users aged 25-34 years with 28.4% out of 100% unlike the people aged 18-24 who are still around 23% (Dep, 2022). We believe that Instagram is an inevitable part of a marketing strategy for a fashion brand in 2022 with its all-visual design. On this platform, you can upload pictures with captions, make engaging posts like polls or just ask a simple question. This platform became very popular in recent years and now has more than 500 million users who check their feed every day. We want to upload short videos since we now know that our target group likes them as said earlier, nice high-quality photos, etc. The whole app is made so easily by users just scrolling down and up which shows that there is a definite way for us to engage with potential buyers (Divakaran, 2021)
</p>
	  <p>TikTok is a media platform that had significant growth in the last two years mainly because of the pandemic but not only. As a platform, it grew because it has short videos that are in fact engaging in a funny or informative way. Currently, it is the most popular and downloaded platform in the past two years, so the choice was not hard  (BBC, 2021). However, it is different from Instagram because you can only share videos and it has a great algorithm that gives you exposure even if you do not have a business account or paid ads. The main reason we chose to use TikTok because of the chance to spread brand awareness thanks to its algorithm. Moreover, we know that this medium is used mainly by the younger generation we cannot deny that its users are growing every minute and the Millennials percentage is growing every year. (tech.co, 2021)
The two platforms are the best way to use the virtual word of mouth/ electronic word-of-mouth since customers can only reshare or even comment and like our posts making us more visible, trusted, and valued.
For the first 3 weeks, we will define our style and how exactly we want our socials to look, and we will keep them simple to see what will spark interest. Our next step will be to make paid posts/ads because we know that potential visitors or buyers will consider us more trustworthy if we have already people following us and liking the content. We will upload weekly testimonials to make the connection between seller-product-buyer more valuable and personal.
