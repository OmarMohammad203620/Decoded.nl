		<h2>Marketing</h2>
		<h1>Communication message and objectives</h1>
		<p>We want to increase traffic on our website and social media accounts at the end of the campaign to prove we have raised awareness of how our brand relates to NFT. Our most important goal is for our target group to be able to identify themselves with our garments and be unique in a way they want to. 
A similar brand to ours is the streetwear brand “Overpriced”. Overpriced describes itself as a brand that creates “fashion for the crypto generation”. Its co-founder Leighton James told Hypebeast: “We are a group of artists looking to create art-powered crypto fashion that aims to challenge the conceptions of what luxury fashion is”  (Elan, 2021). What we took as an example for us, from them is that they want to change the term “fashion” as a physical piece of clothing to something online in the digital world. We see that as a chance to make people feel comfortable and nice-looking not only at their workplace but in the virtual world as well. However, from our interviews and polls on social media, we got that people are not yet familiar with how that (NFT) works. In other words, we will first educate/ provide information to the public about the process and offer them an actual product that is unique for each person who purchases from us. </p>
		<p>Reach objective - We want to reach 500 people on Instagram and 1000 people on TikTok by the 12 of April</p>
      <p>Affect objectives- We want our visitors/followers to feel special and curious to be part of a unique and luxurious community by the end of the campaign (until the 12 of April)</p>
		<p>Response objectives- The goal of the brand is to have at least 300 people click on each post by the end of the campaign on Instagram, 50 likes on TikTok on a video, and 20% visits on the website (until the 12 of April).</p>
		<p>Media objectives: The social media channels we will use are Tik Tok (100 followers) and Instagram (120 followers).
</p>
		<h1>Target audience</h1>
		<p>Description of the demographic and lifestyle: With the internet making the world smaller and people connected, our target audience is based greatly in first-world countries like the Netherlands. According to Statista Research Departments (2022) “ Western Europe had a social network usage penetration of 79% at the beginning of 2021.” (Newcom and Inzicht, January 2020). We target people with expert to medium knowledge regarding cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens. Their lifestyle is ever developing and coping with the new trends in investments and owning digitally valued art pieces.</p>
		<h1>Target Audiance</h1>
		<p>Age:  25-35 years old</p>
	  <p>Gender:  non-specific
</p>
		<p>Income: Elite class</p>
		<p>Education: Higher education diploma. It requires them to have knowledge of social media trends and how to purchase online as well as interest in tech and art and their collaboration.</p>
		<p>Career:  High paid above the standard, directors/managers, influencers, celebrities</p>
		<h1>Media behaviour of the target audience:
</h1>
		<h3>What platforms/social media do they use:</h3>
		<p>Individuals from our target group tend to use social media mainly for communication, however, in 2020 a big percentage (57%) use Instagram for entertainment and finding new brands next to sharing photos, videos, etc., the numbers have a steady growth each year especially when the pandemic of COVID-19 started. Other apps that take a bigger percentage like Facebook (82%) and WhatsApp (89%) they sue for reading news and messaging. (Statistiek and Eurostat, 2020)
